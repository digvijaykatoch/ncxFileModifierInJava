.ncx file modifier in Java. 

So, I had received a coding challenge from a publishing company. They wanted to see if I could code a simple tool that would clean up their ncx files everytime the file was updated. Ncx files are sort of like csv files but relevant to the publishing industry. 

I think it took me about 30 minutes to code this thing and send it across. 

.ncx file reader and cleaner.
